I"q<p>The life of an academic is not just about working in lab, teaching, assignments, exams, classes, and such routine tasks. There are unwritten rules and things which we are not taught in classes. For instance, an undergraduate student might not know what to expect in an academic career, a graduate student might have difficulties while getting started with research, a PhD candidate might not have any idea about how he/she should deal with his/her not-so-friendly supervisor, a post-doc might have difficulty in securing funding for his/her research, a fresh faculty might not know how to teach, and the list goes on.</p>
