I"†<p>The life of an academic is not just about working in lab, teaching, assignments, exams, classes, and such routine tasks. There are unwritten rules and things which we are not taught in classes. For instance, an undergraduate student might not know what to expect in an academic career, a graduate student might have difficulties while getting started with research, a PhD candidate might not have any idea about how he/she should deal with his/her not-so-friendly supervisor, a post-doc might have difficulty in securing funding for his/her research, a fresh faculty might not know how to teach, and the list goes on.</p>

<p>There are so many things like these which we are not taught in schools and colleges, but we anyway have to deal with them in real life. This page is to equip the readers and my fellow academics with tools to tackle such problems. Hereâ€™s a list of the articles and books that would help you to deal with the problems of academic life.</p>
