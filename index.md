LibreNav promotes personal growth and development among the Indian youth.

Due to socio-economic reasons, most students in India choose between a handful of career paths, leading to over-competition in some fields, study programs misaligned with a person’s interests and abilities, unemployment, and unhappiness. We aim to broaden students’ perspectives by highlighting the range of careers they could pursue. We invite guests for a chat where they share their journeys.
