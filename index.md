LibreNav promotes personal growth and development among the Indian youth. We have two primary objectives: Student Education and Young Adult Empowerment.  

Due to socio-economic reasons, most students in India choose between a handful of career paths, leading to over-competition in some fields, study programs misaligned with a person's interests and abilities, unemployment, and unhappiness. We aim to broaden studentsâ€™ perspectives by informing them about the wide array of career paths they could choose. We interview individuals employed in a wide range of fields where they could share the path they took to reach this stage.  

Organisations providing skill training, funding opportunities, etc. are active in the country, but the people who need them the most are often unaware of their existence. We aim to inform young adults about the organisations they could use to find employment or advance their careers. We conduct interviews with organisations to spread awareness. This not only informs the individuals about the opportunities available around them, but it also aids these organisations to attract more employees and volunteers.
