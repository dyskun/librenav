This page lists the sources where you can find the vacancies for PhD and other academic positions. I created this list for myself as I have been looking for open PhD positions, but I decided to put it online so that other interested people can benefit from it. 

I am interested in the positions related to: 
-   Cosmology, Astrophysics, Cosmic Rays, Machine Learning, High Performance Computing, Simulations, Data Analysis, Data Science, etc.

Please feel free to write to me at: [dyskun@yahoo.com](mailto:dyskun@yahoo.com) to say Thanks or if you know about some position related to above mentioned fields that's not listed here.
