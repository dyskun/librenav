I was born into an agricultural family and grew up in a small town in Haryana, India, with fairly limited resources. I have been interested in science since I was little, but of course, I did not know it back then, nor did anyone else around me. I consider myself fortunate to have received good care at home and access to a good school, both of which set the foundation for a fulfilling higher education where I could pursue my interests. My family had little knowledge about the study plans and possible career paths that would suit my interests, so being around other good students and teachers in school played an important role in shaping my education. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Physics from the University of Delhi. While in Delhi, I learned from my peers about the possibility of studying at premier research institutes in India. I graduated with an M.Sc. in Physics from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, where I further developed my research interests and decided to move abroad to follow my curiosity. Now, I am a PhD candidate in astroparticle physics and live in the Netherlands. I was fortunate to grow up in a caring home that focused on my education and had access to bright minds, but most students in India do not get such an environment. I am grateful to the people who guided me, and I want to pay it forward by helping the next generation.

Growing up in Delhi, amidst a family of lawyers and engineers, I found myself in a good school. To be honest, I initially had no clue beyond the typical doctor or engineer paths. However, in the later stage of my schooling, I leaned towards government services like IAS, IPS, etc. But first the graduation step.

Lucky for me, stumbled upon physics in college, and graduated with a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Physics from Delhi University in 2017.

My time at university was a game-changer. It gave me a ton of knowledge and experience, and chatting with peers broadened my perspective on the diversity of our country and the multitude of fields worth exploring. It played a huge role in shaping my personality. 

After graduation, I pursued M.Sc. in Physics at the University of Delhi, but navigating through the course was challenging. Despite the tough times, I pushed through and completed the degree. Following that, I decided to try my luck and appeared for the civil services examination. 

After two unsuccessful attempts at clearing the exam, I decided to have a backup plan and enrolled in M.Tech in Optical Communication at IIT Delhi. I graduated in 2023 and am currently working as a Quantum Researcher at Fujitsu Research in India. 

Looking back on my journey, I'm all about cutting out the trial and error. Future generations deserve the info to make smart choices about their paths.

A software engineer with a passion for education. Growing up in various locations across India due to his father's service in the Indian Air Force, he developed a diverse perspective on life. After completing his 12th grade, he followed his interest in physics, earning his undergraduate degree from the University of Delhi and later pursuing a master's degree from Doon University. Along his educational journey, he became involved in government schools and science outreach programs, eventually joining the Azim Premji Foundation for 2.5 years. There, he collaborated with over 1000 government school teachers, conducting sessions at state and district levels to enhance classroom teaching. Transitioning to the world of computer programming, he worked on curriculum development for computational thinking. Inspired by his experiences, he embraced a full-time role as a programmer, channeling his passion for education and technology.
