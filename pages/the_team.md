I was born into an agricultural family and grew up in a small town in Haryana, India with fairly limited resources. I discovered my love for science at a young age. I consider myself fortunate to have received good care at home and access to a good school, both of which set the foundation for a fulfilling career in which I could pursue my interests. My family had little knowledge about study plans and possible career paths that would suit my interests, so being around other good students and teachers in the school played an important role in shaping my career. I graduated with a B.Sc in Physics from the University of Delhi. While in Delhi, I learned from my peers about the possibility of studying in premier research institutes in India. I graduated with a M.Sc. in Physics from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, where I developed my research interests further and decided to move abroad to follow my curiosity. Currently, I am a PhD researcher in astroparticle physics and live in the Netherlands. I was lucky to grow up in a caring home and have access to bright minds, but many people are not. I want to pay my gratitude to those who guided me by helping the next generation.

Growing up in Delhi, amidst a family of lawyers and engineers, I found myself in a good school. To be honest, I initially had no clue beyond the typical doctor or engineer paths. However, in the later stage of my schooling, I leaned towards government services like IAS, IPS, etc. But first the graduation step.

Lucky for me, stumbled upon physics in college, and graduated with a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Physics from Delhi University in 2017.

My time at university was a game-changer. It gave me a ton of knowledge and experience, and chatting with peers broadened my perspective on the diversity of our country and the multitude of fields worth exploring. It played a huge role in shaping my personality. 

After graduation, I pursued M.Sc. in Physics at the University of Delhi, but navigating through the course was challenging. Despite the tough times, I pushed through and completed the degree. Following that, I decided to try my luck and appeared for the civil services examination. 

After two unsuccessful attempts at clearing the exam, I decided to have a backup plan and enrolled in M.Tech in Optical Communication at IIT Delhi. I graduated in 2023 and am currently working as a Quantum Researcher at Fujitsu Research in India. 

Looking back on my journey, I'm all about cutting out the trial and error. Future generations deserve the info to make smart choices about their paths.
